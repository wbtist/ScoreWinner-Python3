# ScoreWinner-Python3

This is my first Python 3 program.

Score winner GAME

Two player is taking part.
Program asks their name, height and age.

How is score calculated:
Player's age + 5 times player's height.

If they input mistakes, program tryes handle them well.

I hope that my error handling solutions will help others in their codes.

HAPPY CODING! ;)
